### Charlotte Mecklenburg Library Codelab
**What is Library Codelab?** Library Codelab is a technology series based on the concepts of accessibility, collaboration and fun.  Charlotte Mecklenburg Library and community partners will offer monthly meetups for adults to explore different coding languages through projects and hands-on practice. We offer resources, motivation and access to a community of coders in a non-intimidating environment. At each meeting, we focus on a different coding language or concept and work together on a project.
